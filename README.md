# Clean Air Council Climate Tracker

The CAC Climate Tracker will create a city-wide network of sensors to gather data on microclimate and pollution and made the data available to researchers and app developers in order to study the effects of climate change and publicize heat and pollution data in real time. The data will be combined with OpenTreeMaps to study the effect trees have on pollution and their capacity to mitigate climate change at the local level, with the goal of putting a dollar value on a tree in terms of mitigating pollution and the effects of climate change.

### Next steps

The 1284p based boards are printed and tested. We are now developing the protocol for wireless communication, via Xbee and Bluetooth. We will gather the following data as test data:

- GPS
- Temp/Humidity
- Location of trees
- Location of potholes

### Future steps

- gather data on a cloud database
- plot data on map
- compare data to existing tree maps
